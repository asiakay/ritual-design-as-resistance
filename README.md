### **Overview**

This project provides a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript template. It is designed to be a flexible starting point for anyone interested in experimenting with web-based representations of ritual and resistance. The theme draws on anthropological and sociological research that recognizes rituals not only as stabilizing forces but also as powerful tools for subversion and social change[^6][^4][^3].

### **Inspiration \& Context**

The concept of "ritual design as resistance" is inspired by research showing that rituals can be both stabilizing and subversive. Across cultures, ritual practices have been used to challenge dominant ideologies, negotiate power, and enact social change[^6][^4]. For example:

- In Korea, shamanistic rituals have been adapted by student protestors as symbolic acts of resistance against state authority, blending folk culture with political activism[^3].
- In rural Japan, local shrine rituals evolved into mediums for negotiating power and expressing opposition during periods of social transformation[^4].
- Contemporary research explores how repeated gestures, songs, and communal rites become acts of resistance, especially when intertwined with art and politics[^5].

This project encourages you to explore these themes digitally-whether through storytelling, interactive art, or community engagement.

### **Next Steps**

- Check out `TODO.md` for ideas on extending the project.
- Integrating multimedia elements (audio, video, animation) to represent ritual practices.
- Exploring collaborations with artists, activists, or researchers interested in ritual and resistance.
